    <p>According to all known laws</p>
    <p>of aviation,</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>there is no way a bee</p>
    <p>should be able to fly.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>Its wings are too small to get</p>
    <p>its fat little body off the ground.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>The bee, of course, flies anyway</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>because bees don't care</p>
    <p>what humans think is impossible.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>Yellow, black. Yellow, black.</p>
    <p>Yellow, black. Yellow, black.</p>

    <br>
    
    <p>Ooh, black and yellow!</p>
    <p>Let's shake it up a little.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p>Barry! Breakfast is ready!</p>
